## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I think, with this project in particular, I'm starting to think more in terms of a frontend developer: what do I have to work with, what elements should I be using, etc.


### Continued development

Since I've learnt Grid in CSS, I quite like it, and would like to work with it more!

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) - They have a ton of different courses (both free and accessible via subscription) that are interesting and a great help.
